## Motivation

>**“I believe esports will rival the biggest traditional sports leagues in terms of future opportunities, and between advertising, ticket sales, licensing, sponsorships and merchandising, there are tremendous growth areas for this nascent industry”**.
>
>–Steve Borenstein, Chairman of Activision Blizzard’s Esports Division and Former CEO of ESPN and NFL Network

Esports is a booming global industry where skilled video gamers play competitively. In the same way that traditional sports have competitions in baseball, basketball, and football, esports encompasses competitions across a variety of video games. Contrary to common perception, esports is not simply a phenomenon occurring in the basements of unemployed twentysomethings; the industry is real, growing globally, and investable. In fact, over 380 million people watch esports worldwide both online and in person. More people watched the 2016 world finals of popular esports game League of Legends (43 million viewers) than the NBA Finals Game 7 that year (31 million viewers). With its fragmented landscape and digital platform, the esports sector holds promise for a multitude of monetization opportunities.

Esports to reach 385 million viewers in 2017: According to Newzoo, an esports market research organization, in 2017, the audience of esports will reach a total of roughly 385 million people globally. Of this figure, 191 million are “esports enthusiasts” and 194 million are “occasional viewers.” The number of enthusiasts is projected to grow by 50% by 2020, totaling 286 million

Similar to how the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL follow a franchise model with limited membership in their respective sports, esports in North America seems to be following a similar path. A recent announcement from Riot on their League of Legends title has established a franchise model for the North American league. There will be ten spots, each with the hefty price tag of $10 million to buy in. Activision’s title, Overwatch, is also in the process of franchising. In Europe, esports is likely going to follow a promotion and relegation model, given the region’s familiarity with that sporting system in groups like the UEFA Champions League.

As franchising becomes the dominant model, elite teams and organizations will become revenue-generating machines. However, those without franchise spots will be forced to find revenue in secondary leagues or look to establish themselves in titles that have yet to be franchised. They won’t have access to sizeable revenue sharing deals in places like League of Legends and will have to focus on competing in secondary leagues, which offer far smaller cash prizes and sponsorship opportunities. While this consolidation will certainly be painful initially, I view this as a much-needed step forward for the industry as it continues to grow and prune the market. 

The upcoming year should see esports grow to ~$700 million, a growth of 41% from the previous year and an increase from $325 million in 2015. The 2017 figure does not include betting or fantasy esports numbers. Revenues are projected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR (2015-2020) of 35.6%.

## Product

The 2018 International Dota 2 World Championships  conists of two phases. A pre-tournament phase that consits of three seperate events; a Open Qualifier, Regional Qualifier, and a pre "main event" group stage that determines winner and loser brackets in the Main Event. This pre toruanment phase lasts  2 months starting June 14th until August 20th 2018. The second phase, known as the  "Main Event" phase, is where the top 18 teams from the pre-tournmaent phase battle it out for the final championship.

I have deciided to use the pre tournament game data for model training, and the Main Event game data as my testing data. I chose to limit the training data because I believe that the pre Main event matches will be the best indicator of perforance in the Main Event games. Other reasons include the fact that many teams are organized speficically for the World championships so team data prior to June 20th for those teams do not exist.
